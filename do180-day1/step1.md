This is the quiz based on the first day of OpenShift 

In this quiz, you would download an image and create the container with the following characterstics.

_1. Container should be based on image quay.io/shkatara-katacoda/nginx:latest

_2. Container name should be mycustomcontainer{{execute}}.

_3. The container should be running in the background.

_4. Find out the user inside the container and write that to /opt/user. You can just write the name of the user in all small letters.

_5. Find the IP of the created container.

_6. Connect to the container on port 80 and write the contents that you receive in /opt/output

## Once the container is created,

_1. `cat /opt/user`{{execute}}

_2. `cat /opt/output`{{execute}}_

IMPORTANT: As soon as you are done with the above, drop a + in the chat. The person who does them all and drops a + in the chat, wins ;)
