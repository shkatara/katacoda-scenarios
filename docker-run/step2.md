This is the second step.

In this step, you would download and run the containers after downloading the image.

_Containers are just processes on the host, and a process requires a binary or a command. In docker, the image is needed to create a container._  

##Â Task: Downloading the image


`docker pull docker.io/nginx`{{execute}}


Now the image will be pulled on your node which can be seen by looking at the images downloaded locally on your node.

`docker images`{{execute}}
