This is the quiz based on the first day of OpenShift 

In this quiz, you would download an image and create the container with the following characterstics.

1. Container should be based on image `quay.io/shkatara-katacoda/nginx:latest`{{copy}}

2. Container name should be `mycustomcontainer`{{copy}}.

3. The container should be running in the background.

4. Find out the user inside the container and write that to `/opt/user`{{copy}}. You can just write the name of the user in all small letters.

5. Find the IP of the created container.

6. Connect to the container on port 80 and write the contents that you receive in `/opt/output`{{copy}}

## Once the container is created,

1. `cat /opt/user`{{execute}}

2. `cat /opt/output`{{execute}}

IMPORTANT: As soon as you are done with the above, drop a + in the chat. 

## The person who does them all and drops a + in the chat, wins ;)
