This is your first step.

In this step, you would start working with how to find the right image. 

##Â Task: Find the image without any parameters.

This is an _example_ of searching a docker image on the public repository and running a **command**

`docker search quay.io/shkatara-katacoda/nginx`{{execute}}

Using this, you would search on docker.io for the latest tagged nginx image. It does not have any filters and it will give any image from anybody. Probably not to use that in production as the images coming from this command can not really be trusted as they range from images which were just a one time upload and frequently supported images from the vendor.
